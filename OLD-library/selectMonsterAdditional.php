	<h2>Using the Monster Generator</h2>
	<p>I wanted to create an easy to use Monster Generator for D&amp;D 3.5,one which would do most of the work for you and create a plausible monster. So I can create my 12th level Ogre Barbarian and 8th level Vampire Monk in 30 seconds rather than 30 minutes. </p>
	<p>To do this I created a number of templates for each class (class focus) e.g. Thief Scout or Fighter Knight. These define how the skills are to be assigned. Each skill is assigned a type either: </p>
	<table>
	    <tbody><tr><td>P1 - First Primary</td></tr>
	    <tr><td>P2 - Second Primary</td></tr>
	    <tr><td>P3 - Third Primary</td></tr>
	    <tr><td>P4 - Forth Primary</td></tr><tr>
	    </tr><tr><td>S1 - First Secondary</td></tr>
	    <tr><td>S2 - Second Secondary</td></tr><tr>
	    </tr></tbody>
	</table>
   </p>
   <p>The monster generator assigns 80% of the skill point to the Primary skills and 20% to the secondary skills. It then attempts to allocate points evenly to the P1 skills until they are at maximum allowed, then onto P2 skills until these are at maximum then P3 and lastly P4. </p>
   <p>It does the same with the secondary skills, allocating the 20% of the total skill points to all S1 skills until they are maxed out then going on to S2. 
   </p>
   <p>To generate your monster just select your base monster and any classes you want and their levels, decide which skill focus you would like and press submit. </p>
   <p>Your calculated monster will now be displayed. All you need to do is adjust the Ability scores if required, and select any feats the new classes have created. You can also change the armour and weapons, the size, the monsters base hit die and Natural Armour. </p>
   <p>Some monsters have a base level of zero, these are templates for monsters that progress via class, they do not have any weapons or armour as a default and their statistics are all defaulted to 11. E.g. Human, Dwarf, Orc, etc.</p>
   <p>After you have made all the alterations you want press the recalculate button and your monster will be redisplayed with all your changes taken into account. </p>
   <h3>Creating a New Monster</h3>
   <p>New Monsters can be quickly created just type in the monster as it appears in the monster manual. The skill ranks will be calculated automatically (taking into account feats, armour and ability bonuses).</p>
   <p>Do not add the bonus hit points or damage as these will be automatically calculated.</p>
   <p>When entering in the speed use the unarmoured speed (in feet). The monster generator will adjust the speed for the armour. </p>
   <p>If a monster has a special which does not appear on the list use "other" and enter a description.</p>
   <p>The base natural armour class is 10 + the natural armour bonus.</p>
   <p>If a monster is using a weapon or armour remember to give it the appropriate weapon and armour proficiency feats. </p>
   <p>You do not need to enter damage for manufactured weapons. But you do for natural weapons as these can vary from the default. It looks as if quite a few monsters have the improved natural attack feat. E.g. the difference in damage between a Ghoul and a Ghast which are both medium sized monsters. </p>
   <p>Secondary Attacks are for monsters with multiple natural attacks or using multiple weapons at the same time. It is not used to store information about a backup weapon. I may include backup weapons in a later release.</p>
	<h3>Changing a monster</h3>
	<p>The skills ranks shown here are the calculated ranks so the values are not the same as those of the skills printed in the monster manual or typed in the Create a monster page. </p>
	<h3>Class Focus</h3>
	<p>You can create your own class focus so if you really wanted a Paladin Acrobat you can.</p>
    <h3>Information on Feats</h3>
    <p><u>Point blank shot adds</u> +1 to hit and +1 damage to ranged attack so remember to take this off if the range is greater than 30ft.</p>
    <p><u>Improved Natural attack.</u> It seems that quite a few monsters already have this feat as their natural attacks have greater damage than the default. If this is the case then this feat will not do anything to the damage.</p>
    <p>It also only works on the primary attack unless the secondary attack natural weapons are the same as the primary attacks, e.g. Tentacles or multiple heads. </p>
    <p><u>Weapon focus and weapon Specialization</u> only work on the primary weapon unless the secondary weapon is the same as the primary.</p><p>
    <h3>Notes</h3>
    <p>To use the Monster Generator you need to have cookies enabled. I store a unique identifier in a cookie so you can change any monsters you have created.</p><p>
